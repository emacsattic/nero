;;; Commentary:

;; Nero is a fast interactive web browser that runs under Emacs.  It
;; uses 'lynx -dump' to generate page content.  Navigation is
;; typically done via numbered links, a la Conkeror.  See
;; `nero-follow-link'.  Note that cookies that have been set by Lynx
;; continue to apply to Nero.  Nero itself does not set cookies.

;; Better-than-just-browsing interaction with various useful web
;; services is done via elvi, a la Surfraw.  The variable `nero-elvi'
;; contains a list of the currently available elvi.  See
;; `nero-defelvis' for instructions on how to write your own elvi.
;; Elvi are conveniently accessed using the function `nero-query'.

;; Fast access to commonly used pages is available through a
;; programmable hotlist, a la webjump.  The variable `nero-jumps'
;; contains a list of the currently available jumps.  See
;; `nero-defjump' for instructions on how to write your own jumps.
;; Jumps are conveniently accessed using the function `nero-jump'.

;; Standard bookmarks are also supported, see the variable
;; `nero-bookmarks' for details.

;; Facilities for "tabbed browsing" a la (insert name of browser) are
;; available.  Use `nero-new-tab' to make a new tab and
;; `nero-show-tabs' (and/or `nero-next-tab', `nero-previous-tab') to
;; switch between tabs.

;; Editing source code for remote pages is supported; see
;; `nero-edit-source'.  Viewing the GCIDE is partially supported; see
;; `nero-browse-url-force-html' (note: I am planning to introduce
;; improved GCIDE browsing in a subsequent emacs package).

;; Nero saves pages that have been browsed for later use.  This means
;; that reloading must be specifically requested; otherwise, moving
;; around through the pages that have already been loaded once is much
;; faster.  One simple further use of the saved information is
;; provided by `nero-collect-matching-pages', which is can be used to
;; search for pages you have browsed that match a given regexp.
;; Future versions of nero may further capitalize on the presence of
;; this saved information.

;; Nero provides facilities that let you easily plug in Emacs Lisp
;; code to do the following two things:
;;
;;  - to change the way pages display; or,
;;  - to automatically browse the web for you.
;;
;; An example of a function that will adjust the way pages display is
;; `nero-oddmuse-recent-changes-handler', which I use to simplify the
;; presentation of OddMuse recent changes pages.

;; An example of a function with programmatic web browsing behavior is
;; `nero-query-mapquest', which quickly finds and displays maps using
;; the mapquest service, cutting out several steps from the usual
;; interactive routine for achieving the same result.

;; If you want to write you own extensions, these examples may help;
;; but you should also see `nero-browse-url', the main function for
;; display, and `nero-basic-process-processing', the point of entry
;; for new content in the Nero recordkeeping system, for key details.

;; If you are just getting started using Nero, I would advise reading
;; over the user-modifiable variables (those with docstrings marked
;; with a star, below) and settting them to suit your taste and
;; environment.  You should also run `nero-mode-map' from the nero
;; buffer and get to know the key commands.  The examples below should
;; be enough to get you started, if you have everything configured
;; properly (and if not, you should find out as you try the examples).

;; Example usage:
;;
;; M-x nero-browse-url RET http://www.roman-emperors.org/nero.htm RET
;; 7 RET
;; b
;; C-s otho C-a RET
;; o
;; M-x nero-query-wikipedia RET fiddle rome RET
;; 11 M-x nero-download-link RET ~/roman-empire.html
;; C-x C-f ~/roman-empire.html
;; M-x nero-preview-current-buffer RET
;; ,
;; M-x nero-browse-url RET http://www.gnu.org/graphics/gnu-head.jpg RET
;; M-x nero-query-mapquest-local RET 9th and Hennepin RET [requires xv]
;; M-x nero-jump RET aster TAB RET
;; ...

;; Support:
;; 
;; Checks to: 421 Cedar Ave. #11, Minneapolis, MN, 55454.
;; Ideas for works to be done on commission: see AsteroidMeta.
;; Thanks.

;; Ideas for future work:
;;
;; * decode japanese etc.
;;   - I tried to do this, but ran into snags.  It shouldn't be
;;     hard, fetch headers and set codings, but I'm going to save
;;     it for now.
;;
;; * set things up so that several nero windows can be used at once.
;;   - (But tabs seem to work fine for me.)
;;
;; * Maybe add some "session management" features for storing
;;   histories between sessions.
;;   - Could be fun; should be totally modular wrt the current code.
;;   - maybe no page should be deleted from the multiverse, but
;;     rather, when they would be deleted they could be moved
;;     to a hidden "unused" thread.

Each element of a timescape is a page, here represented as a list

miscellaneous properties.

`nero-browse-url' calls `nero-update-timescape'. This function
calls `nero-add-history-element', and will call `nero-set-tab' if
no tabs have currently been defined.  In turn, `nero-set-tab'

  "Create a jump to be used with nero.
Nero jumps are like bookmarks or \"webjumps\", but they can
do a bit more.  The most basic nero jump is essentially just
a bookmark.

The reason you might want more is that sometimes urls change, you
know a consistent way to find them, starting from some
\"landmark\".  You don't want to redefine your bookmark every
time the url changes, but you don't want to physically go through
the process of browsing to the final url either.  What to do?
This macro takes the approach of having nero do the browsing for
you.

NAME is how you might refer to this jump in prose.  BASEURL
is the URL to start from. NUMBERS, if present, indicate the
numbered links to follow, in order.

A function called \"nero-jump-to-\" NAME (suitably marked up)
will be created when this macro runs.

HANDLER can be used to specify alternative instructions on how to
load the final page accessed by the jump.  For one example,
see `nero-oddmuse-recent-changes-handler'."
